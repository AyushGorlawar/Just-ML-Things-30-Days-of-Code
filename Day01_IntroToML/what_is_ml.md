# What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to **learn from data** and improve their performance **without being explicitly programmed**.

## Formal Definition

> "Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." ‚Äì Arthur Samuel (1959)

---

## How it Works (Simple Explanation)

Instead of writing rules manually, ML uses **algorithms** to find patterns in **training data** and make predictions or decisions based on new data.

For example:
- In traditional programming:  
  **Data + Rules ‚áí Output**
- In ML:  
  **Data + Output ‚áí Rules (Model)**

## Core Components of ML

1. **Dataset** ‚Äì The collection of data used for training/testing.
2. **Features (X)** ‚Äì The input variables (e.g., age, height).
3. **Labels (Y)** ‚Äì The target output (e.g., yes/no, price).
4. **Model** ‚Äì A function/algorithm that maps X ‚ûù Y.
5. **Training** ‚Äì The process of learning patterns from data.
6. **Evaluation** ‚Äì Checking how well the model performs on unseen data.

## Goal of ML

To build models that **generalize well** ‚Äî that is, they perform accurately not just on training data but also on **new, unseen data**.

## Real-World Examples

| Application            | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Email Spam Filter      | Learns to classify spam vs. not-spam emails  |
| Movie Recommendations  | Suggests movies based on past viewing data   |
| Credit Scoring         | Predicts if a person is likely to repay loan |
| Face Recognition       | Identifies people in images                  |
| Voice Assistants       | Understands and responds to speech           |

## Why Learn ML?

- Powers modern technologies like self-driving cars, chatbots, AI assistants.
- High demand across industries: health, finance, retail, etc.
- Helps in **data-driven decision making**.

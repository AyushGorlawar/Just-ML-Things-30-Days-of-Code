#  Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Theory

SVM is a powerful supervised classifier that finds the **optimal hyperplane** that best separates classes with the **maximum margin**.

---

##  Concepts

- **Margin**: Distance between the hyperplane and closest points (support vectors)
- **Kernel Trick**: Transforms data into higher dimensions for non-linear separation

---

##  Kernels

- Linear
- Polynomial
- RBF (Radial Basis Function) – Default

---

##  Pros

- Effective in high-dimensional spaces
- Works well when margin is clear

---

##  Cons

- Slow for large datasets
- Requires feature scaling

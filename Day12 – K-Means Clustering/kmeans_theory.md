#  K-Means Clustering â€“ Theory

K-Means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** that groups data into `K` clusters by minimizing **intra-cluster variance**.

##  How It Works

1. Choose `K` (number of clusters)
2. Randomly initialize centroids
3. Assign points to the nearest centroid
4. Recompute centroids
5. Repeat until convergence

##  Use Cases

- Market segmentation
- Image compression
- Document clustering

##  Evaluation Metrics

- Inertia (sum of squared distances)
- Silhouette Score
- Elbow Method (to find optimal K)

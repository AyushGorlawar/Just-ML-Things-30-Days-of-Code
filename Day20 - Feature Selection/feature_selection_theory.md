# Feature Selection â€“ Correlation & Chi-Square

---

## Why Feature Selection?

- Reduces overfitting
- Improves accuracy
- Makes model faster and more interpretable

---

##  Techniques:

### 1. Correlation Matrix:
- For numerical features
- Drop highly correlated features (correlation > 0.8)

### 2. Chi-Square Test:
- For categorical input and categorical target
- Measures dependency between variables

##  Tip:
Feature selection should always be performed **after cleaning** but **before modeling**.

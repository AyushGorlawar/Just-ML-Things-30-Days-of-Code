# âš™Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning

---

## Cross-Validation:
- Split data into multiple folds (e.g., K-Fold)
- Helps reduce overfitting and ensures model stability

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning:
- GridSearchCV: Tries all combinations from a parameter grid
- RandomizedSearchCV: Randomly samples combinations

---

## Tip:
Use **StratifiedKFold** for classification to preserve class distribution.

# ðŸ“Š Clustering Evaluation â€“ Elbow Method & Silhouette Score

Unsupervised models like K-Means need evaluation techniques to decide optimal clusters.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Elbow Method:
- Plot number of clusters (K) vs Inertia (WCSS)
- Look for "elbow" point where WCSS stops dropping sharply

---

## ðŸŒŸ Silhouette Score:
- Measures how well a data point fits into its own cluster vs others
- Range: -1 (bad) to +1 (well-clustered)

---

## âœ… Best Practice:
- Use both Elbow & Silhouette to validate ideal K

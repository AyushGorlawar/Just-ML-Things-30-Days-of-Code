## Key Concepts

- Root Node → First split
- Leaf Node → Final prediction
- Gini Index / Entropy → Criteria for splitting

---

##  Pros

- Easy to understand & visualize
- No need for feature scaling
- Handles both categorical & numerical data

---

##  Cons

- Overfitting on small datasets
- Can become very complex without pruning

---

##  Use Cases

- Credit Risk Prediction
- Medical Diagnosis
- Fraud Detection

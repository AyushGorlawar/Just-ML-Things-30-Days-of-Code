# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Classification Project

A classic machine learning problem to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, class, gender, etc.

---

##  Dataset:
- `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

---

##  Features used:
- `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`

---

##  Steps Performed:
1. Data Cleaning (missing values in Age & Embarked)
2. Feature Encoding (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
3. Feature Scaling (for numerical variables)
4. Logistic Regression model training
5. Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##  Goal:
Predict whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0)

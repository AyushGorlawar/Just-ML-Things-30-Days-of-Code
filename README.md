# Just-ML-Things-30-Days-of-Code
A personal 30-day journey to sharpen my Machine Learning skills through daily coding

# Day 1 (20-06-2025): Intro to ML + Setup

âœ“ Today I brushed up the basics of Machine Learning â€” what it is, its types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement), and how ML fits into the world of data science and AI.

âœ“ I also set up my ML environment with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Created three basic files:

âœ“ - `what_is_ml.md` â€“ Theory and introduction  
âœ“ - `types_of_ml.md` â€“ Categorization with examples  
âœ“ - `setup.ipynb` â€“ Environment test + sample code

# Day 2 (25-06-2025): Linear Regression

âœ“ Today I explored **Linear Regression**, one of the simplest and most powerful algorithms in supervised learning.

âœ“ I learned how to fit a line to data using `scikit-learn`, understand the slope and intercept, and evaluate the model using **RÂ² score**.

## Created two files:

âœ“ - `linear_regression_theory.md` â€“ Core concept, equations, and use cases  
âœ“ - `linear_regression_sklearn.ipynb` â€“ Hands-on implementation using a toy dataset (X vs y)

ðŸ“Š Bonus: Also plotted the regression line to visualize how well the model fits the data.

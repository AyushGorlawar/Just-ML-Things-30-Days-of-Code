# Just-ML-Things-30-Days-of-Code
A personal 30-day journey to sharpen my Machine Learning skills through daily coding

# Day 1 (20-06-2025): Intro to ML + Setup

✓ Today I brushed up the basics of Machine Learning — what it is, its types (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement), and how ML fits into the world of data science and AI.

✓ I also set up my ML environment with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and essential libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Created three basic files:

✓ - what_is_ml.md – Theory and introduction

✓ - types_of_ml.md – Categorization with examples

✓ - setup.ipynb – Environment test + sample code

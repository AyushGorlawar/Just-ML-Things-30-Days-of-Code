#  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) â€“ Theory

PCA is an **unsupervised dimensionality reduction** technique used to project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space by maximizing variance.

---

##  Why PCA?

- Reduce computational cost
- Remove noise and redundancy
- Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D

---

##  How It Works

1. Standardize the data
2. Compute the covariance matrix
3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4. Select top-k components (principal components)
5. Project data onto new axes

##  Use Cases

- Data compression
- Noise filtering
- Visualizing complex datasets (e.g., MNIST, gene expression)

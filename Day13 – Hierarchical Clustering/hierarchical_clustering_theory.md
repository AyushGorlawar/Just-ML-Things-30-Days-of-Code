## ðŸ”§ Types:
- **Agglomerative** (bottom-up)
- **Divisive** (top-down)

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
- Dendrogram: Tree-like diagram showing merges
- Linkage Methods: Single, Complete, Average, Ward

---

## ðŸ“Š Use Cases:
- Gene expression data
- Document clustering
- Market segmentation
